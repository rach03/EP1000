            <h3>Raster Graphics - GIMP</h3>
            <p>
                This is my first time using GIMP and my past projects and modules hardly require the use of the software. it took me some time to figure out and follow the steps as we were going through the practice in class, but I started to get the hang of it after asking for help from my friends and trying out a couple more times.<br>
                Firstly, we open up an image. Next, we had to use the 'free select' tool to outline and select the areas that we wanted to include for our final image. Afterwards, we insert another image of any desired background into a 2nd layer. Once I was done, I make the necessary adjustments for the two layers to fit together. <br>

            <h3>Vector Graphics - Inkscape</h3>
            <p>
                Just like Gimp, I have never used Inkscapebefore today so it was quite fun as I drew out my logo as well. <br>
                Firstly, I set my image and reduced the opacity. Next, I created a new layer and started to trace out each the first component with the beizer function. After I am satisfied with the shape, I choose the my desired colour for the area I traced. With every companent, I create a new layer, and I found out that O ws able to rearrange the layer sequence as well! This is my end final image. <br>

            <p>
                In this exercise, I'll be designing a mug with an arc at the base.
                <ol type="1.">
                    <li>Create a sketch of how the shape of the mug (without the handle) will look like.

                            <li>As we will be using 'Revolve' in our next step, we will only have to draw a profile.</li>
                            <li>Avoid overlapping the vertical axis.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>'Revolve' the profile drawing, select the vertical axis as the point of axis.
                        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                            <li>By selecting, the vertical axis as your point of axis, you're ensuring there is no holes in the centre as you 'Revolve' the profile.</li>

                    </li>
                    <li>Next, select the front plane when creating a new sketch. Then, I used the outline of the cup as reference while drawing my handle.

                            <li>This is to ensure the handle will be inline with the cup once it extruded.</li>

                <ol type="1.">
                    <li>Firstly, create a sketch of the polygon (hexagon) and extrude the drawing.

                            <li>Try to draw from the point of origin so that the next few steps will be made simpler.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Next, create another sketch on the 'XY' axis. Draw an inverted right angle triangle at the top-right corner of the body.
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Draw a horizontal and vertical line from the edge of the body.</li>

            <h3 id="#3d">3D Printing - Knight Chess Piece</h3>
            <p>
                We were assigned to 3D print a chess piece of our choice. I wanted to give the knight piece a try since it has the most interesting shape out of the other pieces. <br>
                <ol type="1.">
                    <li>
                        First, I went to  find and download a template/image of a knight chess piece.<br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        After adding a new canvas to my file and making sure that it is of a correct scale and is on the right plane and position, I created a new sketch on the plane where I inserted my canvas on.<br>
                        <img src="resources/img/blog/knight-drawing1.png" width="360px">
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Next, I drew out a profile of the chess base with the hollow part excluded and click 'FINISH SKETCH'. <br>
                        <img src="resources/img/blog/knight-drawing2.png" width="360px">

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        With the drawn profile of the chess base, I used the 'Revolve' function to create a full revolution of the  hollowed base.<br>
                        <img src="resources/img/blog/knight-drawing3.png" width="360px">
                        <img src="resources/img/blog/knight-drawing4.png" width="360px">
                    </li>
                    <li>Afterwards, I created another sketch on the same plane.</li>
                    <li>
                        By using 'Control Point Spline', I traaced out the rest of the knight piece over the canvas. By using this function, I am allowed to make adjustments in the outline if there is any parts I'm dissatisfied with. And when I am happy with the shape, I used the ''Sketch Scale' to change the size without it affecting the drawing shape. <br>
                        <img src="resources/img/blog/knight-drawing5.png" width="360px">
                    </li>
                    <li>Once I have complete tracing the rest of the chess piece, I used 'Extrude' and make sure it was 'symmetry' to extrude of the requireed thichness of the chess piece.</li>
                    <li>
                        Upon finishing my 3D sketch, I have to prepare the file for printing. I saved the file and exported it as an <a href="resources/img/blog/f3d files/EP1000_CHESS PIECE_P2023520 v1.stl">stl file</a> to get it ready for printing.
                    </li>

                </ol>

                At first, there was an error in printing my chess piece. Since there is nothing supporting as it prints, the gravity acting on it caused a part of the chess piece to appear as shown below:     <br>       
                <img src="resources/img/blog/knight-3d (error).png" width="360px"> <br>
                To resolve this issue, I tried printing it again, this time with supports. Here is the final piece! <br>

            <h3>3D Modeling</h3>
            <p>
                For this assignment in creating a design that demonstrates the benefits of 3D printing, I have drawn out a 3-dimensional cylindrical maze! This was a fun assignment that allowed me to experiment the functions in Fusion 360. For this design, the most challenging part would be to create the actual maze. What makes it different from regular mazes is the curved surface of the maze created around the cylinder. Hence, it will be most suitable to 3D print the cylindrical maze, unlike regular mazes with flat surfaces. 
                <img src="resources/img/blog/indiv 3d assignment.png" width="360px">
            </p>
            <p> 
                To create this design, firstly I created a cylinder. Then, I created a cross-section area of the cylinder (aligned with the cylinder and starting from the centre) and downloaded an SVG format file of a maze design from a <a href="https://www.mazegenerator.net/">maze generator</a> I found online. After I have positioned the SVG file over the cross-section such that it is of the largest possible scale within the cross-section and the width is aligned with one another, I made used of the 'Emboss' function to wrap the design around the cylinder. Afterwards, I just added a few final details to complete my cylindrical maze. <br>

            <h3>Lasercut Parametric Box</h3>
            <p>
                For this assignment, we are required to design a music box. My music box is a simple design of a record player on the top lid and musical notes at the front. In addition, it is designed to have a whole on the right side to allow access to the mechanism crank and a moveable lid.
                <ol type="1.">
                    <li>
                        Firstly, I set up some parameters. This way, if the dimensions are incorrect or the size of the final product is not right, I'll be able to change the dimensions quickly without having to reset/redraw everything from the start. <br>
                        <img src="resources/img/blog/music box-drawing parameters.png" height="320px">
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Now that I have all the parameters set, I went ahead and start creating my sketch. I selected the top plane to start off with my music box base. <br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        After completing the sketch and extruding it to the set thickness. I created a new component and selected my front plane to complete the front part of the box. 
                    </li>
                    <li>Then, I extruded out the thickness and use the 'Move/Copy' function to make a copy for the back part.</li>
                    <li>I repeated step 3 and 4 for the left and right sides on the left plane.</li>
                    <li>For the top lid, I drew over the topof the box so that my lid design will be inline with the rest of the box.</li>
                    <li>Once I was done drawing out my music box. I needed to produce the sketches. To do this, I clicked on each surface and press 'P' to 'Project' each sketch and save as a DXF file.</li>
                    <li>
                        After I am done, I create a new design and open the DXF files onto a plane. This is when I made any final adjustments to my sketch as well as add in my desired designs. Once completed, I saved the file and exported it as an DXF  to get it ready for printing. <br>
                        <iframe src="https://gmail908803.autodesk360.com/shares/public/SH35dfcQT936092f0e43019e55e6a3df2095?mode=embed" width="800" height="600" allowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true"  frameborder="0"></iframe>                    <li>During my printing process, I faced a difficulty. When I inserted my thumbdrive and open my file, I found that a part of my design was missing. And after a while of trying to search for it through other prev files, I wasn't able to locate that part of my design anywhere. Luckily, I still had a saved image of the design in my folder and I was able to upload to get the design engraved onto my music box.</li>
                    <li>
                        Here are my cut-outs. At first the engraving for my front and top side was a bit light, so I increased the power and reduced the speed for the engraving components to get a darker and clear design. (I had to cut on a new piece of plywood as the first ones had fallen out and is no longer in line, which is why the  design looks blury)<br>

                    </li>
                    <li> After cutting, it's time for me to layout and assemble the music box! (I used hot glue gun to attach the pieces)
